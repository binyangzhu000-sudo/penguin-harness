/**
 * Landing ↔ plugin-library sync: the home page's Skills section presents the built-in skills,
 * so every publicly listed skill has to appear in both dictionaries and
 * nothing else may (hook packages are not skills and are not listed there). Derived from the
 * library directories — the same source docs' skills-sync test reads — so shipping a skill
 * without listing it here fails instead of leaving the section quietly short.
 *
 * Membership only, not order and not which card a skill sits in: the categories are the
 * plugin manifests' call, pinned in packages/plugins' own tests, and a reordering inside a card
 * is not a regression worth a red suite.
