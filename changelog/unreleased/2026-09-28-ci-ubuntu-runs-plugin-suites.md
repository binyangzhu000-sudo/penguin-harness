The ubuntu `rest` test shard named its three packages explicitly, so no package under `plugins/` — nor `packages/plugin-test` — ran its tests on Linux, while macOS and Windows ran them all. The Linux sandbox backends' live suites (`sandbox-bwrap`, `sandbox-dsh`), which skip everywhere but Linux, therefore ran nowhere.

## Details

- The ubuntu `rest` shard is now recursive with exclusions, like macOS and Windows: everything except core, server, web and cli (which have shards of their own). A new package is scheduled by default instead of by remembering to list it.
- The shard builds `sandbox-bwrap`, so its live suite confines with the bwrap the plugin vendors rather than one on the runner's PATH.
- A step before the tests lifts Ubuntu 24.04's AppArmor restriction on unprivileged user namespaces for that shard, and prints the host's user-namespace settings and `bwrap` path, so a skipped live suite can be told apart from a refusal by the product.
